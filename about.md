I'm Joren, an IT proffessional from Belgium. 
I'll be using this blog primarily as a digital yellowpad to jot down any snippets, one-liners, documentation, etc. I need or want to remember. Maybe they can be of interest to anyone out there but be warned: the content of this blog comes without any form of warranty! I will not accepts any liability if for some reason your server comes to live to eat your cat and steal your identity!
