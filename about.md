I'm Joren, an IT proffessional from Belgium.

I'll be using this blog primarily as a digital yellowpad to jot down any snippets, one-liners, documentation, etc. I need or want to remember. Maybe they can be of interest to anyone out there. Just be warned: the content of this blog comes without any form of warranty. I will not accept any liability if your servers come to live, eat your cat and steal your identity!
