A moment of silence... as today I got my blog up and running using GitHub and Jekyll to render my pages!

This repo will be used primarily to dump all my thoughts, documentation and sippets I want to save for personal reference. They all come without any guarantee. So be warned, use any of the info found here at your own risk :)

Special thanks to @barryclark for creating the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) and @jeroenvda for pointing me to this interessting project.
