Christmas came very early this year!
Why? Today I picked up my Watchguard Firebox x750e :)

I've been thinking about running a firewall at home for quite some time now. So on a calm morning, while scrolling through [2dehands](http://www.2dehands.be/) (the local Belgian eBay if you whish), I found this Watchguard x750e. I immediately contacted the seller, we made a deal and 3 days later... she's sitting here on my desk!

Look at her... who wouldn't want to have a nice and shiny 1U red firewall sitting in his/her rack?

Now let's find out what this beauty can do! There is a very nice [community](http://forum.pfsense.org/index.php/topic,20095.0.html) and [wiki](https://doc.pfsense.org/index.php/PfSense_on_Watchguard_Firebox#X-Core-e) over at the pfSense site explaining how to run pfSense on all sorts of Watchguard hardware. So I guess I'll have a lot of reading to do for now.

List of next steps I would like to address:

- Upgrade hardware
	- Upgrade RAM
	- Upgrade CPU
	
- Install pfSense
	- Redesign home network to fit the red beauty

- To be determined!
